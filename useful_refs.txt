Based on reading the Epigenomics workflow at [1] I wanted to share some literature we've been using in my lab for related problems.

Peak calling - http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/05/22/nar.gku351.long

Gordon Smyth has shown that when calling peaks to compare groups/samples/whatever, for a given histone mark, the best way to go is to lump all your raw data for the groups to be compared into 1 massive bam file and call peaks on the combined data.  Then, differential expression/comparisons/whatever, are performed by estimating peak heights from the original files, but using the common peaks.  

Enhancer ID - http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/08/26/gr.121905.111.full.pdf 

Beer lab at JHU using SVM-based approach to predict enhancers from DNase/ChIP/*-seq data.  Uses SHOGUN toolbox, can be installed locally, also has a website (kmersvm.beerlab.org).    


Looking forward to meeting everyone
